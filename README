Hack the F1
-----------

Starting a project to reverse engineer the F1 protocol and build a couple of
tools to open up Traktor to MIDI control:

   1. A software shim between Traktor and the F1 to extract MIDI from the
      HID packets going to the F1 device and insert HID packets from MIDI
      inputs back into the stream.

   2. Firmware hacks to allow devices to pretend to be an F1 and receive and
      send events to Traktor.

Join us on the WIKI and over email. We're looking for talented coders with
experience in USB-MIDI and HID device descriptors, hardware drivers on Mac
or Windows, installer packages to make the hacks simple to use. Contact us
to join up.
